# NLP Text Analysis and Synthesis Toolkit

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit designed for comprehensive text analysis and synthesis. It utilizes unigram and bigram models to perform statistical text analysis, enabling users to process, analyze, and generate text automatically. This toolkit is ideal for those interested in exploring the fundamentals of NLP, text processing, and statistical language models.

## Features
- **Corpus Preprocessing**: Streamlines text data for analysis, removing unnecessary formatting and preparing it for processing.
- **Unigram and Bigram Models**: Implements basic yet powerful statistical models for text analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzes text data to determine the frequency and distribution of words and word pairs.
- **Automated Text Generation**: Generates coherent and contextually relevant text based on the analysis of a given corpus.
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Anaconda (recommended for managing dependencies)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danieldawan/NLP-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd nlp-toolkit
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a new Anaconda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n nlp-env python=3.8
   conda activate nlp-env
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your text data and save it as a `.txt` file.
2. Edit the `main` function in `NLP.py` to specify the path to your text file.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python NLP.py
   ```
